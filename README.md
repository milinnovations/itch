It's a Chart!

# Origins

This project can be considered a fork of [react-calendar-timeline](https://github.com/namespace-ee/react-calendar-timeline). Our goal is to rewrite that project in TypeScript, keep its dependencies up-to-date and extend its capabilities when we need to. We decided not to make a regular fork because most of the benefits of a fork would be lost anyway. After rewriting the code in TypeScript, it will be too different to pull changes or create pull requests.
